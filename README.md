# GDAL_Introduction
GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an X/MIT style Open Source license by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single raster abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats. <br />
The  `ogrinfo` program lists various information about an OGR-supported data source to stdout (the terminal). By executing SQL statements it is also possible to edit data.<br />
# Note that:<br />
the resutls of the command lines can be found in [`ComandResultReport`](https://github.com/Daham-Mustaf/GDAL_For_-geospatial_analysis/tree/main/ComandResultReport)<br />
Check which version of GDAL
```bash
gdalinfo --version
```

```bash
$ OgrInfo countries.shp
```
List all features of all layers:
```bash
$ OgrInfo -al countries.shp 
```
Getting more Help comprehensive listing of options offered by ogr2ogr or ogrinfo, run the following at the FW Tools Shell.
```bash
$ OgrInfo --help
$ ogr2ogr --help
```
Getting full help of `ogrinfo` or  `ogr2ogr` 
```bash
$ ogr2ogr --long-usage > ogr2ogrfullhelp.txt
```
tha result flag `--long-usage` saved in ogr2ogrfullhelp.txt.<br />
 Getting full information about ESRI shape fiel. we can use  `-so`
```bash
$ OgrInfo -so countries.shp
```
List raster/image file details
```bash
$ gdalinfo sample_DEM.tiff > ListRaster.txt
```
summary of the metadata:
```bash
$ OgrInfo -ro -so countries.shp
```
`-so` listing of individual features and show only summary information like projection, schema, feature count and extents, we can eqxtend and combine with sql quries.

```js
$ OgrInfo -so countries.shp -sql " SELECT * FROM countries"
```
` -sql statement`: Execute given SQL statement and save result.<br />
Get full details for a Specific Record of an ESRI Shapefile.
```js
$ OgrInfo -so countries.shp -sql " SELECT * FROM countries" -fid 0 >firstRowRecord.txt
```
the result stored in [`firstRowRecord.txt`](https://github.com/Daham-Mustaf/GDAL_For_-geospatial_analysis/blob/main/ComandResultReport/firstRowRecord.txt)<br />
List all metadata domains available for the dataset.
```bash
$ OgrInfo -listmdd countries.shp
```
List the format drivers that are enabled. The result also shows whether the format can be used for
read and/or write:
```bash
$ OgrInfo --formats countries.shp 
```
For both these GDAL commands, the default output format is GeoTiff; if you need a different format, you must use the `-of` option and assign to it one of the outputs produced by the previous command line
```bash
 $ gdalinfo --formats
 ```
Converting an ESRI Shapefile to GeoJSON format: `Ogr2ogr` is a command-line tool that is part of the GDAL suite. You can use it to import an ever-growing list of spatial and non-spatial formats into PostgreSQL/PostGIS. 
```bash
$ ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs "EPSG:4326" country.geojson countries.shp
```
`-t_srs srs_def`: Reproject/transform to this SRS on output. <br />
Selecting features by attributes using `ogr2ogr` Select Records and Create a New Shapefile:
```js
$ ogr2ogr -sql "SELECT * FROM countries WHERE NAME='Germany'" germany.shp countries.shp
```
Count Records in an ESRI Shapefile, in countries.shp we would like to count the number of countries
```js
$ OgrInfo -sql "SELECT COUNT(NAME) AS NumberOFCountries FROM countries" countries.shp >NameOFCountries.txt
```
Count DISTINCT Records in an ESRI Shapefile:
```bash
OgrInfo -sql "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FIPS) FROM countries " countries.shp> DISTINCTFIPS.txt
```
Analyzing PostGIS table with `OgrInfo` use the `-fid` option just to display one record from the table:
```bash
 OgrInfo PG:"dbname='postGis' user='postgres' password='postgres'" xyz -fid 1 >xyzTable.txt
```
 Query PostGIS to get a list of Points in xyz Table:
 connect to database:
 ```bash
 postGis-# \c postGis  
 ```
 Query PostGIS Points in xyz Table:
 ```js
 postGis-# SELECT ST_AsText(geom) AS the_geom 
 FROM xyz 
 ORDER BY x DESC LIMIT 100;> xyzQury.txt
 ```
 Extract data from PostGIS to a GeoJSON file: by using postgis `t_asgeojson(geom)` function: the result asved in postGistogeojson.json file.
  ```js
 SELECT st_asgeojson(geom) FROM xyz LIMIT 100;
 ```
Extract data from PostGIS to KML the function `ST_AsKML(geom)` returns the geometry as a Keyhole Markup Language (KML) element. 
```js
SELECT ST_AsKML(geom) FROM xyz LIMIT 100;
 ```
 # Importing with ogr2ogr:<br />
Ogr2ogr can be used to import numerous kinds of vector data formats. weâ€™ll cover the more common vector formats people need to load.
